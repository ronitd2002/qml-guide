# Beginner's Guide to Quantum Machine Learning and Variational Algorithms.
This year's IBM Quantum Spring Challenge had a problem on a Variational Classifiers with bird classification based on their Quantum embeddings. Quantum Machine Learning had seen a meteoric rise since the last couple of years and so has research into the same. Their can be several branches for this kind of a guide with specialized focus on one. However I would like to keep this as general for publicreference as possible. The possible diversions might be Graph Quantum Machine Learning, Quantum Chemistry Simulation, Quantum Time Series Modelling and Quantum Tensor Networks and many many others. 

This reposiroty takes serious help and reference from the book **Supervised Learning with Quantum Computers** by Francesco Petruccione and Maria Schuld.
